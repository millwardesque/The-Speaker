Hey fellow developers!

This is a quick sample setup provided as an example on how to set up the Retro 2D Characters, using Unity's built-in Animator component.
This includes only the standing/idle animations and walking animations for all four directions, just as a quick demo on how you could set things up.

Happy developing!
