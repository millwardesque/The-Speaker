Hey! Thanks so much for purchasing the pack.
Here's just a few quick notes on the animations and animator included in v 1.3.

ANIMATIONS
All animations are readily available and use the light male base by default.
The sprites can be exchanged using the new SpriteSkin script.
To see how to set it up, inspect the included prefabs and how they're set up.

ANIMATOR
The animator is just a sample/template and is not driven by a script.
All the animations are in the animator tree and (somewhat) organized.

Hope these new assets help in getting you started using the Retro 2D Characters!
